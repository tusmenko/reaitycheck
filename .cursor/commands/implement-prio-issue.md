# Implement priority project issue

Proceed with **implementing the highest-priority project issue** from start to finish.

**Pick the issue:** Sort by **Priority descending** (P0 first, then P1, then P2) and choose the **first** one — i.e. the highest-priority issue. Use the project board / GraphQL to read the Priority field.

Then follow **[.cursor/rules/issue-implementation-flow.mdc](.cursor/rules/issue-implementation-flow.mdc)** and **[docs/issue-implementation-flow.md](docs/issue-implementation-flow.md)** step by step. Do not skip steps.

If you have additional constraints or a specific issue in mind, add them in your message after invoking this command.
