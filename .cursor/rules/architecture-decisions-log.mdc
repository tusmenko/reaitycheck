# Architecture Decisions Log

When planning work that involves **architectural decisions**, add a new entry to the decisions log.

**Location**: `docs/decisions-log/` — see [TEMPLATE.md](docs/decisions-log/TEMPLATE.md) for format and steps.

## When to Add an ADR

Add an entry when a decision involves:

- **App layout / structure** — routing, folder structure, module boundaries, monorepo vs multi-repo
- **New technologies or services** — databases, frameworks, third-party APIs, SDKs, infra
- **Deployment & infra** — hosting, CI/CD, environments, scaling
- **Data architecture** — sync strategy, caching, migration approach
- **Auth / security model** — auth strategy, session handling, API security
- **Integrations** — how external systems are integrated, patterns (sync vs async)
- **Performance / reliability** — queuing, retries, circuit breakers, observability approach

## When NOT to Add an ADR

Do **not** add entries for:

- Plain functional changes — new features, bug fixes, small improvements
- UI-only changes — layout tweaks, styling, component variants
- Content or copy updates
- Configuration tweaks without architectural impact
- Refactors that don’t change architecture (e.g. extracting a helper)

## Format

Each ADR must include:

1. **AI proposal** — what was suggested
2. **Human alternative** — what the user proposed (if any)
3. **Decision** — what was chosen and why
4. **Consequences** — benefits and trade-offs

Follow the structure in `docs/decisions-log/TEMPLATE.md` and update `README.md` with the new ADR.
