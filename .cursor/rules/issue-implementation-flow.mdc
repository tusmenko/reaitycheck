# Issue implementation flow (project issues)

When you are asked to **implement a project issue**, **pick an issue from the project**, or **work through the issue workflow**, follow the flow in this document step by step:

**[docs/issue-implementation-flow.md](docs/issue-implementation-flow.md)**

That flow covers: prerequisites (e.g. `gh auth status`), picking only **Ready** + **ai-friendly** issues, creating the branch (prefer `gh issue develop`, then fallback to manual), setting status to In progress, implementation plan (including **link to the GitHub issue**), implementation and commits (one per step if multistep), and PR with structured description and `Closes #N`.

Do not skip steps. When in doubt, open the doc and follow it.

## Set issue Status to "In progress" (after creating the branch)

Right after creating and checking out the branch for the issue (via `gh issue develop` or manually), set that issue's **project Status to "In progress"**. Only for issues on the **ReAItyCheck project** (project 2, owner @me).

1. Note the **issue number** (e.g. `3`).
2. Resolve the **project item ID** (replace `3` with the issue number):
   ```bash
   ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-list 2 --owner @me -L 100 --format json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.content.number == 3) | .id')
   ```
3. Set the item's Status to **In progress**:
   ```bash
   gh project item-edit --id "$ITEM_ID" --project-id PVT_kwHOAqmy8c4BPKom --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOAqmy8c4BPKomzg9p7fs --single-select-option-id 47fc9ee4
   ```

**ReAItyCheck project IDs:** Project `PVT_kwHOAqmy8c4BPKom`, Status field `PVTSSF_lAHOAqmy8c4BPKomzg9p7fs`, "In progress" option `47fc9ee4`. Requires `gh` and network.
