# Issue implementation flow (project issues)

When you are asked to **implement a project issue**, **pick an issue from the project**, or **work through the issue workflow**, follow the flow in this document step by step:

**[docs/issue-implementation-flow.md](docs/issue-implementation-flow.md)**

That flow covers: prerequisites (GitHub MCP + git), picking only **Ready** + **ai-friendly** issues, creating the branch (MCP **`create_branch`** then git checkout, or fallback to local git only), setting status to In progress via **Projects toolset**, implementation plan (including **link to the GitHub issue**), implementation and commits (one per step if multistep), and PR via **`create_pull_request`** with body containing `Closes #N`.

Do not skip steps. When in doubt, open the doc and follow it.

## Set issue Status to "In progress" (after creating the branch)

Required whether the branch was created via MCP **`create_branch`** or locally (fallback). Set the issue's **project Status to "In progress"** (ReAIty Check project only). Use the **Projects toolset** to update the project item's Status. If the tool is unavailable, add an issue comment asking the user to move the card to In progress.

**ReAIty Check project IDs:** Project `PVT_kwHOAqmy8c4BPKom`, Status field `PVTSSF_lAHOAqmy8c4BPKomzg9p7fs`, "In progress" option `47fc9ee4`.
