# ReAIity Check

> AI is coming for your job.  
> But first, let’s see if it can handle edge cases.

**ReAIity Check** started as a reaction to the current AI hype cycle —  
claims of inevitable AI dominance, agent-driven development replacing engineers, and the growing belief that competence is optional.

This project exists to test that belief against reality.

## Why this exists

We are told that:

- AI agents will replace most roles in IT
- architecture and decision-making can be delegated
- trusting agents is already a requirement

At the same time, models:

- fail basic logical traps,
- hallucinate confidently,
- misunderstand simple constraints,
- break on edge cases a human handles instinctively.
- default to popular decisions that may not fit your use case

This repository treats that contradiction as a starting point.

## What this project does

- Runs the same non-trivial prompts across popular models and agents
- Tracks results across versions and time
- Surfaces failures benchmarks tend to average out
- Focuses on meme edge cases, not academic scores

Examples: Strawberry Problem, Alice's Brother, Fabricated Citations, ets.

The goal is simple:
**track progress until agents can solve simple edge-case problems at least as reliably as humans.**

That point might arrive.
When it does — *we are, in fact, blessed / fucked.*

## The meta-experiment

This project is built mostly with AI agents (Claude + Cursor), with minimal manual coding.

It deliberately asks:

- where agents help,
- where they mislead,
- and how often they appear correct while being wrong.

---

## The core question

AI agents are powerful tools.
They can significantly increase productivity.

But they do not replace competence.

Before trusting them with architecture, decisions, or jobs —
are you comfortable with how they behave on simple problems?

---

## What this is not

- Not a scientific benchmark
- Not the definitive ranking
- Not an anti-AI statement
