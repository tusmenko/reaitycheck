# Challenge submission rules

By submitting a challenge you agree to the following. Please read before submitting.

## Content you must not submit

- **Personal data** (yours or others): real names, emails, addresses, identifiers, and similar.
- **Confidential or sensitive information**: secrets, credentials, proprietary data, health or financial details.
- **Content that violates laws or third-party terms**: e.g. [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/terms) and model-provider acceptable use (no illegal content, abuse, deception, harassment, or similar). You are responsible for complying with those services’ terms.
- **Anything you do not have the right to share.**

---

## What we do with submissions

- Submissions may be **run through external APIs** (e.g. [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/terms)) for evaluation. You are responsible for ensuring your content complies with those services’ terms.
- We may **reject or remove** any submission at our discretion (e.g. if it fails checks, violates these rules, or for operational reasons).
- There is **no guarantee** that a submission will be added to the challenge ladder.

## License you grant

By submitting, you grant ReAIityCheck a **non-exclusive, royalty-free license** to use, store, reproduce, and process your submission (prompt, expected result, trick description, and optional fields) to operate the service, including: sending it to third-party APIs (e.g. [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/terms)) for evaluation, running kill-rate checks, and, if accepted, displaying it in the challenge catalog (with optional credit to you). You agree that we may allow those providers (e.g. OpenRouter) to process your content as required by their terms.

## Your responsibility

- You are at least **13 years old**; if you are under 18, you have your parent or guardian’s permission to submit.
- You are the **creator or owner** of the submission, or you have the **necessary rights and consents** to submit it and to grant the license above.
- Your submission does **not infringe** any third-party right (e.g. copyright, privacy) and does not cause ReAIityCheck or its providers (e.g. OpenRouter) to **violate any law**.
