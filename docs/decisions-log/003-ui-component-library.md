# ADR-003: UI Component Library

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Date** | February 2026 |
| **Status** | Accepted |

**Context**  
We need a consistent, accessible UI with charts and form components.

## Considered alternatives

| Role | Choice |
| ---- | ------ |
| **AI proposal** | shadcn/ui |
| **Human alternative** | Next.ui |
| **Decision** | shadcn/ui. Chosen for full ownership (copy-paste), no runtime dependency, good accessibility, and Recharts integration. |

## Consequences

- ✅ Copy-paste components — full ownership  
- ✅ Accessible and customizable by default  
- ⚠️ Must maintain components ourselves
